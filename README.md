cfml framework

This is a framework I started creating awhile ago to see if I could mimic the cfwheels framework but in my own coding style so it would be easy to maintain.

It currently is pretty rough, but I have a basic MySQL ORM finished, no joins yet,  and basic A/E/D and selects done.

I started this on another computer that had GIT so it will be a bit before I commit code.
